• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
 If we create a file in our repository named .gitignore, Git uses it to determine which files and directories to ignore, 
 before we want to make a commit.A gitignore file should be committed into our repository, 
in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that clone the repository.

• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Fast-Forward in git means that a pull/rebase was able to update directly to the new revision without having to perform any merges.
In certain situations, Git does a fast forward when we merge a branch that is ahead of our checked-out branch


• Why should you have different branches?
Git object data for multiple commits. A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master.
 As we initially make commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Remote repositories are versions of project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.
 We can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write.
